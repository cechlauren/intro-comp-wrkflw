# this will not track any changes I make to mine
# for collaborative software development you can set
# a fork up to track changes and update them based on the
# repo you have forked from

# go to your forked repo version
# click "clone or download" (green button)
# copy the text
# clone the forked repo

git clone git@github.com:wconnell/intro-comp-wrkflw.git


# this will fail unless you have already set up a connection
# between your computer and github via ssh
# reference this webpage to setup a ssh key on github

# Follow the directions on the site closely...
# First check if you have a ssh key on your computer! you should!
# avoid generating extra ssh keys! they clutter everything up!
